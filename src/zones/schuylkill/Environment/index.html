        <h4>A healthy river</h4>
        <p>
            The water quality of the Schuylkill River is checked everyday by professionals and volunteers. Such factors as acidity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity (how cloudy the water is), and temperature can have substantial effects on the water quality. But one of the best indicators is what organisms are living in the stream. Monitors look for invertebrates (animals without a backbone) 75% certain ones only survive if the water is clean, so if we find them we know the river is healthy. Others can survive in polluted conditions ¾ if we only find these, we know the river is not clean. Move the slider to see more examples.
