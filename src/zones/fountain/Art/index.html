        <h4>The Fountain</h4>
        <p>
            The different paths climbing up the cliffs were constructed in the 1820s to allow visitors to reach the reservoir and overlook the Water Works. The original South Garden marble fountain is no longer here; the current one, known as the Water Works Fountain, was constructed in 2006, followed by a major renovation to the entire site.
                <br><br>
            If you look towards the cliff, you will see the Peace Fountain built into the wall. This fountain dates back to 1865 and was created to commemorate the end of the Civil War.
