    The spot in which you are now standing, known as the South Garden, was originally going to be the site of three large water-powered factories. Fortunately this plan was abandoned and Fairmount Park was created, with this section as its southernmost end. While the primary purpose of the park was to provide a clean source for drinking water, from the start it was designed to be a place of natural and artistic beauty for the people of Philadelphia to enjoy.
