        <h4>Pumping up water</h4>
        <p>
            An essential component of the Fairmount Water Works pumping station in 1815, was GRAVITY. Water was pumped up from the Schuylkill, to the top of the hill of Fair Mount to be stored in a large manmade reservoir that would hold three million gallons of water.
                <br><br>
            From the heights of the reservoir, fifty-six feet above the highest ground in the city, water would flow by gravity into the existing system of pipes to businesses, homes and hydrants throughout the city through wooden pipes that were later replaced by cast iron pipes.
