        <h4>Water powered water wheels</h4>
        <p>
            Inspired by the bold system of aqueducts supplying pure water for the great cities of the Roman Empire two thousand years earlier, Frederick Graff, chief engineer of the Philadelphia Watering Committee, designed a new water distribution system in Philadelphia in 1811. The hill of Fair Mount was purchased and the Philadelphia Fairmount Water Works pumping station began operations in 1815. At the foot of Fair Mount (where you are now standing) intake of the Schuylkill Water Works by two steam engines (one backing-up the other) provided a more reliable system of water distribution. Following a series of fires and other problems with steam power, in 1822, the Fairmount Water Works was altered to harness the power of the Schuylkill River itself to pump river water into the reservoir through water wheels.

            Each massive wheel, fifteen feet wide and fifteen or sixteen feet in diameter, turned at eleven to fourteen revolutions per minute, powered by the weight of water as it filled the long buckets affixed to the circumference of the wheel. A crank on the axle of the wheel transmitted the power generated by the turning wheel to the shaft of a pump. The pump sucked water out of the flume and pushed it through a pipe to the reservoir atop Fairmount.
