        <h4>From the Roman Empire to the Watering Committee of Philadelphia</h4>
        <p>
            Inspired by the bold system of aqueducts supplying pure water for the great cities of the Roman Empire two thousand years earlier, Frederick Graff, chief engineer of the Philadelphia Watering Committee, designed a new water distribution system in Philadelphia in 1811. The hill of Fair Mount was purchased and the Philadelphia Fairmount Water Works pumping station began operations in 1815. At the foot of Fair Mount (where you are now standing) intake of the Schuylkill Water Works by two steam engines (one backing-up the other) provided a more reliable system of water distribution. Following a series of fires and other problems with steam power, in 1822, the Fairmount Water Works was altered to harness the power of the Schuylkill River itself to pump river water into the reservoir through water wheels.
