        <h4>About the Fishway</h4>
        <p>
            Certain types of fish have an instinct to swim upstream often to where they were originally hatched on the river. The Fairmount fishway first attracts these fish by creating a current guiding them to the first chamber of the fishway. The fishway has eleven chambers with the water level in each chamber slightly higher than the one below it. The fish are therefore able to make a series of small leaps to get above the dam, much like going over rapids. You can visit and see a window in one of the chambers or watch live footage of the fishway online.
