        <h4>Fish swimming home</h4>
        <p>
            Millions of American Shad, Blueback Herring, Striped Bass and other fish used to swim up the Schuylkill River before it was dammed in 1821. In 1979 they built the first fishway and upgraded it in 2009. During the last fish count [the stat i s from 2006] almost 17,000 fish of 26 different species traveled through the Fairmount Fishway. Each year, thousands of tiny young shad are released into the Schuylkill upriver of the dam so that they will yearn to return.
