        <h4>Water Molecule</h4>
        <p>
            Rivers are the lifeblood of most terrestrial ecosystems. A healthy river is a vibrant ecosystem with a wide diversity of plants and animals living in it, which provides vital nutrients to land organisms as well. Different parts of the river have different functions, from a stretch of rapids that might be incorporating more dissolved oxygen into the water for fish life to a wetlands which be filtering out contaminants in the water.

            Rivers start out at their source or headwaters. Some may emerge from a spring in the ground or snow melting in a mountain lake. Generally a bunch of small streams, called tributaries, empty into each other, creating bigger and bigger rivers; the Schuylkill River, for instance, would be a tributary of the Delaware River, as it empties into it in South Philadelphia.

            As the river flows down to its mouth, such as the sea or a lake, it carves a channel in the landscape. Along slow curves it may have deep pools, maybe with turtles and catfish living in them. As it goes over rapids the water is fast and turbulent and are often places you can find small invertebrates. Riffles aren?t as rough a ride as rapids, but are fast and shallow. A run is a smooth-flowing straightaway part of the river, where you might find fish like bass.
