    Water is the basis of all life. Life itself started in water billions of years ago and every living cell from a muscle cell in your heart helping to pump blood to your body to a single-cell amoeba in drop of pond water to a leaf cell soaking in the sun's rays 100 meters up a giant redwood tree uses water.

    All the great human civilizations started on waterways, with cities thriving or failing based on their access to safe drinking water. In 1682, William Penn chose the spot where the Delaware and the Schuylkill Rivers meet to found the city of Philadelphia. And two hundred years ago, the Fairmount Water Works started pumping drinking water out of the Schuylkill.
