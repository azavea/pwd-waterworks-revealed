The monumental building of the Museum serves as one terminus of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, with City Hall at the other end. During the construction phase, the standpipe, along with the distribution arch, was blasted into a pile of rubble, although it had been delineated on the architect's drawings for the Museum complex.",
