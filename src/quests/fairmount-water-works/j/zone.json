        "text": "In the nineteenth century the small temples of Fairmount Water Works arranged at the water's edge had become a symbol of Philadelphia. Now what might be considered a twentieth­‐century symbol stands grouped on the top of Fairmount in the connected large temples that form the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The construction of the Museum was begun in 1919 on the site of the reservoirs on Fairmount, fulfilling a desire for a public art gallery, which had been proposed for various locations in the city since the 1876 Centennial exhibition. The monumental building of the Museum serves as one terminus of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, with City Hall at the other end. During the construction phase, the standpipe, along with the distribution arch, was blasted into a pile of rubble, although it had been delineated on the architect's drawings for the Museum complex.",
