        "text": "Fairmount Water Works today maintains its graceful presence in the Philadelphia landscape and serves as a picturesque reminder of the past when its buildings, gardens, and dam were depicted in drawings, paintings, woodcuts, lithographs, and engravings. Views of the waterworks were also transferred to porcelain and to pottery as the scene most representative of Philadelphia. These images and the remembrance of the days long gone enrich our perception of the present in contrast to the past &mdash; when a stroll in a garden and a viewing of waterwheels in motion were the grand moments of a Sunday afternoon.",
