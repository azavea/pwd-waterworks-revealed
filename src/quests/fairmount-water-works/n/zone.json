        "text": "Many persons were instrumental in the creation and the operation of Fairmount Water Works. Most noted among them were Frederick Graff (1774-1847) and his son, Frederic Graff, Jr. (1817-1890). Responsible for the design of the Fairmount Water Works facility-the buildings, most of the machinery, the distribution system, the gardens immediately surrounding the waterworks&mdash;[Frederick Graff], in effect, ran the waterworks. Graff, Jr., continued the tradition, serving from 1847 to 1856 and again from 1867 to 1872, becoming a leading civil engineer in his own right, and playing a major role in the development of Fairmount Park.",
