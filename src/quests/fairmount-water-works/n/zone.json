        "text": "Many persons were instrumental in the creation and the operation of Fairmount Water Works. Most noted among them were Frederick Graff (1774-1847) and his son, Frederic Graff, Jr. (1817­‐1890). As a young man, the elder Graff was an assistant to the architect and engineer Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Graff served as superintendent of the first Philadelphia Waterworks at Centre Square, the site today of City Hall, from 1805 and continued at Fairmount until his death in 1847. Responsible for the design of the Fairmount Water Works facility &mdash; the buildings, most of the machinery, the distribution system, the gardens immediately surrounding the waterworks &mdash; he, in effect, ran the waterworks. Graff, Jr., continued the tradition, serving from 1847 to 1856 and again from 1867 to 1872, becoming a leading civil engineer in his own right, and playing a major role in the development of Fairmount Park.",
