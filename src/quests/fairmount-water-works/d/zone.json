        "text": "The golden age at Fairmount Water Works covers the period roughly from 1830 to 1850. Receipts were well over expenditures, the waterwheels were operating efficiently, and the public was enthusiastically responsive to the well-designed buildings and the picturesque setting. During this time European visitors were greatly impressed with the beauty and the power of the works, especially since it had been conceived and built in this country by locally trained engineers.",
