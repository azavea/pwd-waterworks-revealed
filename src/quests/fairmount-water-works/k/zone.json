        "text": "The south garden at the waterworks had been built by 1835, and soon the idea of a large urban recreational park caught the fancy of many citizens, with additional land being acquired for today's Fairmount Park. By the time of the consolidation of the city in 1854, however, additional pumping stations that had already been erected by the districts along the river eliminated the city's dependency on water power at Fairmount. Although technological improvements were made with the installation of water turbines beginning in 1851, Fairmount Water Works began to deteriorate by the 1880s. River pollution reached untenable proportions in the 1890s, and the facility was decommissioned as a pumping station in 1911.",
