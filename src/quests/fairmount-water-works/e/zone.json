        "text": "From 1815 to the consolidation of the city with its districts in 1854, Fairmount Water Works was the sole pumping station supplying Philadelphia with water, and for part of that time it also supplied the districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Southwark. After water power replaced steam, which used expensive fuel to power the waterworks' pumps, the financial rewards for the city were considerable. In 1844 the city purchased the Lemon Hill property, which had once belonged to Robert Morris and was directly upstream from the works, to prevent industries from locating on water lots so close to the city's water supply.",
